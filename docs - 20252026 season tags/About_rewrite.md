# About Page: The Humble Solo Creator Draft

This file is a workspace for refining the copy of `about.html`. We are aiming for a tone that is **humble, generous, and mission-driven**, while establishing Russell as a **Universal Designer**.

---

## 1. Hero Section
**Old:** PERSONNEL BIO / THE MISSION
**Draft:** A PERSONAL MISSION / PUNCHING UP REAL LIFE

---

## 2. What We Do (The Giving Energy)
**Drafting Notes:** Focus on the idea of theater as a gift to the city/community.

> **Proposed Copy:**
> It feels like eavesdropping. It’s fully scripted.  
> Stories hiding in Houston.
>
> Plot Swap is an exercise in experiential design. I research, write, and direct scripted plays that hide in the real world. It’s theater staged where life is already happening: an overly confident third-date proposal, a best man speech that turns into a confession, or a painting class with a teacher’s pet crush. 
>
> The craft is in the build:
> Curiosity earns attention. Attention invites connection. Connection unlocks emotion. Emotion becomes memory.

## 3. Meet Russell (The Solo Architect)
**Drafting Notes:** Balancing the "troublemaking kid" with the "Pro Designer."

> **Proposed Copy:**
> **RUSSELL VARNER // HOUSTON**
> ### Meet the Architect
>
> I'm a Universal Designer. Most days, I'm building video games or solving complex design problems. But I've always felt that the most important "interface" we have is each other. 
> 
> As a kid, my imagination often got me into trouble. Today, I use that same restless energy to unlock the potential in the ordinary. I don't have a big production company or a marketing team. It’s just me, a few dedicated actors, and a belief that **lived entertainment deserves another chance.** 
>
> If you've ever looked at a local business or a city street and asked, *"What if this could be more?"* – then you and I speak the same language.

## 4. Support the Mission (Community Impact)
**Drafting Notes:** Frame the support as sustaining a public good.

> **Proposed Copy:**
> ### Sustain the Secret
> Every Plot Swap performance is an investment in our community’s story. Because these shows are free to discover and hide in plain sight, they rely entirely on the generosity of people who believe in the mission.
>
> If you want to help me keep "punching up real life" in Houston, consider supporting the journey. Every dollar goes directly into production costs, actor stipends, and keeping the theater alive on our streets.

## 5. Partnering with Businesses (The Bridge)
**Proposed New Section (Subtle):**
> ### For Local Spaces
> If you own a bar, a shop, or a space that feels like it has a story to tell, I’d love to help you tell it. I partner with local businesses to create immersive experiences that bring people together in meaningful, face-to-face ways. Let's make something unforgettable.
