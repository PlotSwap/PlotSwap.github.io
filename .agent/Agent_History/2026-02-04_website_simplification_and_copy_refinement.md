## Session: Website Simplification & Copy Refinement

---

## What We Did

### Phase 1: Website Simplification (Completed Previously)
- Removed all show listings from homepage (Pheromones, Hair Bae)
- Simplified hero section to focus on mission
- Added "What We Do" section explaining hidden-in-plain-sight theater
- Added "For Businesses" section
- Updated About page to mention Pheromones as past evolution
- Removed Season 1 from primary navigation (moved to footer)
- Simplified CSS animations (removed 3D transforms)

### Phase 2: Homepage Copy Refinement (Today's Session)
Went through homepage copy line-by-line to ensure it sounds authentic and clear.

**Hero Section:**
- Changed "Underground theater in Houston" → **"Houston's Hiding Theater Company"**
- Changed "We perform scripted stories in real life" → **"Scripted theater in disguise"**
- Changed "Just memories that feel real" → **"Just stories worth telling"**

**What We Do Section:**
- Changed examples from generic (breakup, mysterious conversation, confession) → **specific and varied** (scam artist exposed, cheater getting caught, family secret revealed)
- Changed "witness" → **"overhear"** (more intimate, accidental)
- Simplified value prop from "People deserve stories..." → **"We give away stories to create memories. Something you carry with you, not something you paid to see."**

**Two Ways to Experience It:**
- Changed "Don't know it's theater?" → **"Think it's real?"**
- Changed "Know it's theater?" → **"Know it's an act?"**
- Removed "discuss it with the community" (doesn't exist yet)
- Changed to **"But what's going to happen? Sit back and watch the fireworks."** (adds mystery)

**For Businesses Section:**
- Changed headline from "For Businesses" → **"Word of mouth, on demand."**
- Updated copy to emphasize value: **"Your customers get an unforgettable story. They tell their friends. Your place becomes part of the legend."**

## Key Learnings & Principles

### 1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
- User's previous mistake was losing clarity for aesthetic
- Every revision prioritized: "Does a first-time visitor understand what we do?"
- Example: "Scripted theater in disguise" is clearer than "Scripted moments in masquerade"

### 2. **Active Voice & Specificity**
- "Hiding" (active) > "Hidden" (passive)
- "Scam artist exposed" (specific) > "mysterious conversation" (vague)
- "Overhear" (intimate) > "witness" (spectator)

### 3. **No Repetition**
- User is sensitive to word repetition
- Example: Caught "masquerading as real" + "feel real" repetition
- Solution: Removed redundant "When theater hides in plain sight" sentence

### 4. **Conversational Tone**
- User prefers direct, conversational language
- "We give away stories" > "People deserve stories" (less grandiose)
- "But what's going to happen?" > "Free theater for you" (more mysterious, less cheap)

### 5. **Genre Variety in Examples**
- Original examples were all relationship drama
- Final examples span: crime (scam artist), romance (cheater), family (secret)
- Shows range without overwhelming

### 6. **Dual Audience Consideration**
- Homepage serves both potential audience members AND venue partners
- "We give away stories" works for both (neutral)
- Separate "For Businesses" section addresses venues specifically

### 7. **Push Back When Needed**
- User explicitly requested: "Push back on things that aren't great"
- Example: Birthday clown idea was rejected (tone mismatch, undercuts legitimacy)
- User values honest feedback over agreement

## Important Context for Future Agents

### Brand Voice
- **Confident but not arrogant**: "Houston's Hiding Theater Company" (playful), not "The world's first..." (grandiose)
- **Clear and direct**: Avoid over-explaining or being too poetic
- **Conversational**: Write like you're talking to a friend, not pitching investors

### Mission
- **Current concept**: Hidden-in-plain-sight theater (scripted moments disguised as real life)
- **NOT current**: Interactive theater (that was Pheromones, Season 1)
- **Core value**: Creating memories people carry with them, not transactional entertainment

### Dual Audience Model
- **Audience Type 1**: People who don't know it's theater (genuine surprise)
- **Audience Type 2**: People who know it's theater but not what will happen (hunting for the moment)
- Both are valid and intentional

### Design Principles
- **Full transparency** about what Plot Swap does (not underground mystique)
- **Word-of-mouth discovery** is part of the experience (but not secretive)
- **Two primary CTAs**: Join mailing list + Host shows
- **Simplicity over technical complexity**: Previous site was too complex

### What's Still Needed
1. **Mailing list integration** (currently just opens email - needs real signup form)
2. **Season 1 page header** (clarify it's past work, not current offering)
3. **About page copy refinement** (optional, could use same treatment as homepage)
4. **Business page copy refinement** (optional)

## User Preferences
- **No em-dashes** (use commas instead)
- **No word repetition** (very sensitive to this)
- **Wants honest feedback**, not just agreement
- **Iterative refinement** - prefers to workshop copy together rather than accept first draft
- **Clarity is priority #1** - learned from past mistakes

## Next Session Should Focus On
1. Mailing list setup (critical - it's a primary CTA)
2. Review homepage in browser
3. Season 1 page clarification
4. Optional: Refine About/Business page copy with same approach
